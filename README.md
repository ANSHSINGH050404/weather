## Description

Provide a brief overview of your project. What does it do? What problem does it solve? What technologies does it use?

**Example:**

> This is an Android application that helps users track their daily expenses. It uses Jetpack Compose for the UI, Room for local data persistence, and follows the MVVM architecture pattern.

## Features

List the key features of your application.

**Example:**

*   User-friendly interface for adding and categorizing expenses.
*   Daily, weekly, and monthly expense summaries.
*   Visualizations of spending patterns (e.g., charts and graphs).
*   Option to set budgets and receive notifications when approaching limits.
*   Data export to CSV or other formats.

## Screenshots (Optional)

Include screenshots or GIFs to visually showcase your app's UI and functionality.  You can use Markdown image syntax:
**Note:**  You'll need to replace `path/to/screenshot1.png` with the actual path to your image files within the repository (or a URL if you're hosting them elsewhere).  It's common to put screenshots in a dedicated `screenshots` or `docs/images` folder.

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to set up and run your project.  Be clear and concise.

**Example:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Android Studio (latest version recommended)
    *   Kotlin 1.8 or higher
    *   Android SDK with a target API level of 33 (or your project's target)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
3.  3.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Start Android Studio and select "Open an Existing Project."
    *   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project.

4.  **Build and Run:**
    *   Sync the project with Gradle files.
    *   Build the project (Build > Make Project).
    *   Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Architecture

Briefly describe the architecture of your project (e.g., MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture).  You can include a diagram if you have one.

**Example:**

> This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.  The UI (View) is built with Jetpack Compose.  The ViewModel handles UI logic and interacts with the data layer (Model), which uses Room for local database operations.

## Dependencies

List the major libraries and dependencies used in your project.  You can include links to their documentation.

**Example:**

*   [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
*   [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Persistence library providing an abstraction layer over SQLite.
*   [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous programming.
*   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Part of Android Architecture Components, manages UI-related data.
*   [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - (Optional, if used) An observable data holder class.
*   [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - (Optional, if used) Dependency injection framework.
